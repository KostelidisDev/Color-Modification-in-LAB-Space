# Color Modification in LAB Space

This MATLAB project processes an input image by resizing it to a user-defined height while maintaining its aspect ratio. The resized image is then converted into the LAB color space for specific manipulations.

# Description

This MATLAB project processes an input image by resizing it to a user-defined height while maintaining its aspect ratio. The resized image is then converted into the LAB color space for specific manipulations:
	•	The top-right quadrant has its chromaticity channels (A and B) set to zero, effectively desaturating that section.
	•	The bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants are modified to set the L channel (lightness) to 50, while one chromaticity channel is neutralized in each.

The processed image is finally converted back to the RGB color space and displayed. This project demonstrates image transformation, color space manipulation, and quadrant-based editing techniques.
